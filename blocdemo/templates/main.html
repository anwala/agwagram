<p><i>B<sup>3</sup>T</i> (<i>BLOC-Based Behavioural Tool</i>) is an online utility to help in analyzing and quantitatively describing the behaviour of Twitter accounts. 
  In an age of growing misinformation, B<sup>3</sup>T can assist in identifying likely bot accounts as well as tracking shifts in their behaviour.</p>
<p>While BLOC can be applied to other social media accounts, this tool currently supports Twitter exclusively. </p>
