        Agwagram is a cutting-edge online behavioral analysis tool designed to
        help researchers, journalists, social media analysts, and any other
        interested parties in identifying and quantitatively describing the
        behavior of <em>Twitter</em> (known now as <em>X</em>) accounts. With
        the global rise of misinformation, it offers a unique solution to track
        shifts in behavior, powered by the novel BLOC language algorithm, and
        identify potential bot accounts with ease. Capable of detecting a broad
        range of legitimate and suspicious behaviors, as well as accounts which
        display both, Agwagram offers a flexible and generalizable method for
        analyzing Twitter accounts - making it an essential tool for anyone
        looking to study and detect coordinated disinformation on social media
        platforms.
